well, it was a lot faster than doing it manually. And a lot easier.

question
How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

i can easliy go to a past version an compare with a new version to identify bugs that have been introduced due to changes


question
What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

answer
pros- i choose  when to commit based on logical changes
cons- i may forget to commit

question
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

answer
its more likely that programs have files that are interrelated. For example a function thats defined in one file may be used by multiple files. hence its key that keep track of changes to multiple files.
google docs on the other hand mostly deals with text files, which are less likley to be interrelated.

question
How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

answer
git log gives the commit id for a file. use git diff with 2 commit ids to find the difference between files

question
How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?

answer
I can always use checkout to go back to an older version

question
Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

answer
check out changes made to this file
