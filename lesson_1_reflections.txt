question
Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

answer
its more likely that programs have files that are interrelated. For wxample a function thats defined in one file may be used by multiple files. hence its key that keep track of changes to multiple files.
google docs on the other hand mostly deals with text files, which are less likley to be interrelated.
